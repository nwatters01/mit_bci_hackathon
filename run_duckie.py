    The smoothing kernel is a half-triangular window, so recent events have
    highest weight.
    
    With just smoothing alone, it is difficult to prevent over-turning.
    Specifically, since we use right/left jaw-clenching as our EMG control, it
    is difficult for the driver to rapidly switch between left and right turns.
    As a result it is much easier to rapidly correct for under-turning (where
    correcting requires clenching harder on the same side) than over-turning
    (where correcting requires clenching on the other side). Consequently, we
    include an automatic correction for over-turning, namely a "rebound"
    feature in the smoothing kernel.
    
    If rebound_delay is not None, then the kernel has a "rebound" which is a
    negative triangular window component for more distant history.
    
    Args:
        window: Int. Window size of the positive component of the kernel. If
            rebound_delay is None, then this is the size of the resulting
            kernel. Otherwise, the resulting kernel has length
            2 * window + rebound_delay to include the negative and positive
            components and the delay between them.
        rebound_magnitude: Scalar. Weight of the negative "rebound" component of
            the kernel relative to the positive component.
        rebound_delay: None or int. If None, no rebound is used. If int, adds a
            negative "rebound" component with given delay before the positive
            component.
